# 100-Days-Of-AI-ML-NLP-Code

In this repository, I will upload my 100 Days ML Code which I have learned from different courses(Upgrad,Coursera, udemy, edx, udacity), different websites blogs, different tutorials from YouTube, books, and research papers. From 01-Jan-2022 till ####

Machine Learning
Deep Learning
Computer Vision
Natural Language Processing

## Day 6: January 6th, 2022 [->](https://github.com/dataisamazing/100-Days-Of-AI-ML-NLP-Code/tree/main/day06)
Today's Progress : Understanding Accuracy,Precession,Recall
Let's Assume I have a trained a bot to allow only Dogs to Dog show which is standing near the entrence of the event.

**Accuracy**:- Accuracy says how much my bot is capable of allowing if any new dogs come to show. As per the below result new dog as 50% chance to make it to the Dog show.

**Precision:-** Precision is out of all Dog prediction how much our bot was capable of predicting, In the below case it is 57% means which means what ever has made to Dog
show only 57% are dog rest is something else(even house,bird and car has made it to the show)

**Recall:-** Out of all dog truth how many we got it right. Our bot couldnot allow 2 dogs even though our dogs were pefect but bot missclassified then as non dog so 67% time if any
new dog comes chances are thre it make it to the show.
